# canton

The above code will create an empty dictionary informationCanton of type [String: UInt]. The variables cantonName, cantonPopulation, cantonSize, and cantonLanguage are defined with their types, and initialized as implicitly unwrapped optionals with a value of nil. The ! symbol after the type indicates that these variables are optional and can have a value of nil at the time of initialization.

To use these variables later in the code, they should be assigned an actual value, as demonstrated with the assignment of "Sample Canton" to cantonName in the corrected code.
